# Indivdual Assignment 4


 
## Project Description
Here i made a simple website to focus more on how the interactive components should work. This is for the 4th individual assignment. 


# #Navigation 
When you open the page you will see the header containing all the different components. the first component is the navbar in the header and ther est is contained in their categories. when you click on each category the content will pop up and you can interact with them and see how the different components work. When you changed to a different category the previous category will be hidden so that only the one that you interact with will come forth.
